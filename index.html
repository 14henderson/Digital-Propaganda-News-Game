        <h2>The Properganda Card Game: Background Setting</h2>
        <p><b>Setting: </b>New-Friesland is a democratic nation bordered by the Netherlands and Belgium. Jump into the North Sea and swim your heart out for a while and you’ll reach the United Kingdom. </p>
        <p>The country has a long history of sovereignty and self-rule: many New-Frisians take pride in their resounding victory over the Dutch Republic in the Great Land Battle of 1703, which set New-Frisian independence in stone. Today, the country is a member state of the European Collective (EC), which functions just like the European Union but is different enough to avoid copyright infringement. It’s also a member of the United Nations and the World Trade Organization, and the country trades actively with its many foreign partners. </p>
        <p>Like all European countries, New-Friesland is facing a number of hot-button issues that have to do with the economy, trade, national sovereignty, immigration and integration, the climate, and so on. New-Friesland’s media is free, fair and pluralistic, and people from all ideological backgrounds are free to raise their voice. This makes public debate about these issues vibrant, heated, and sometimes controversial.</p>
        <p><b>Your role:</b> As a New-Frisian citizen, you are outraged by the issues that are plaguing your country today, and fed up with the enormous amounts of misinformation about the topics you care about. You’re participating in this debate by writing an article. Your goal is to use and misuse any information you have available to convince the public of your point of view. Facts are sacred, of course, but if the other side is willing to lie to prove a point, why can’t you? </p>
        <p>What point of view you’re trying to get across depends on what character you’re playing as: Dennis in Denial, Paula for Political Posturing, Mike the Money Changer, Dana and Fox the Co-Conspirators, or Leon the Professional. Each has a different background and different motivations and methods for influencing public opinion. Have a look at your Character Card to see who you’ll be representing. If you could now read your character card. </p>
        <p>How to play: You’ll be creating an article about a topic from the point of view of your Character. To be as convincing as possible, you’ll have to make use of different misinformative and propagandistic techniques. You’re given a Character Card, a Source Card, and a set of paragraph templates. </p>
        <p>Your Character Card shows your character’s background, viewpoints and goals, and the techniques they use to achieve them. The Source Card shows the topic and the full range of available information on this topic. You can use this information as selectively as you wish: use anything useful, ignore anything useless, or make stuff up out of thin air. </p>
        <p>The paragraph templates, put together in the right order, form the body of your article: title, subtitle, headers, and content. You have many choices to choose from; use them wisely. You win by creating the most convincing article for your character. Think about what you’re trying to achieve, and how each paragraph helps you do so. </p>

        <h2>Imigration and Integration</h2>
        <p>New-Friesland, as a member of the Commonwealth of United 
            Republics, has received an increasing number of people coming 
            in from regions outside of Europe that are in various degrees of 
            conflict. This has sparked a society-wide debate about immigration, 
            integration, refugees and asylum seekers. Recently, the New-Frisian 
            Council for Asylum Affairs (CAA) published a report about a rise in 
            incidents in and around detention centres where asylum seekers reside 
            while awaiting the results of their application. The report finds a steep 
            rise of such incidents between 2015 and 2016, and offers a number of 
            explanations. Its conclusions are summarised here:</p>

        <h3>Observations:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Number of incidents reported to CAA in 2015: +/- 3000</li>
            <li>Number of incidents reported to CAA in 2016: 9166</li>
            <li>Number of incidents then reported by CAA to the police: 3637</li>
            <li>Number of police reports filed: 813</li>
            <li>Number of people charged with a crime: 166</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Explanations</h3>
        <p>
            n 2016, the incident registration procedure at detention centres 
            underwent a number of reforms that made reporting incidents much 
            easier and subject to stricter rules. This has contributed to more 
            incidents being reported.
            The number of asylum seekers in New-Friesland detention centres has 
            risen from 31.600 in 2015 to 58.900 in 2016.
            Detention centres are operating above capacity, which has increased 
            tensions between individual asylum seekers as well as between groups 
            of different national or ethnic origin.
            Male asylum seekers often arrive alone, without their families. The lack 
            of opportunities for people to build a stable life causes boredom and 
            anxiety.
            The people living in areas around detention centres are increasingly 
            dissatisfied with the lack of concern for their frustrations about 
            immigration, which stirs tensions within the community.
            Most incidents were resolved internally, without police intervention. Of 
            the incidents that were eventually reported to the police, some were 
            incidents involving attacks on detention centres by locals, and others 
            were instances of asylum seekers behaving aggressively towards local 
            people.
