title1 = "Council for Asylum Affairs: improved registration procedure explains apparent spike in detention centre incidents"
title2 = "Number of incidents in detention centres for aslylum seekers more than triples."
title3 = "The CAA cover-up"
title4 = "SHOCKING! Detention centre crime wave, and the mainstream media say NOTHING!"

introduction1 = "The Council for Asylum Affairs (CAA) writes in a report that the number of incidents in and around detention centres has risen slightly in 2016 compared to 2015"
introduction2 = "A new report by the New-Frisian Council for Asylum Affairs (CAA) admits that the number of crimes in detention centres has gotten completely out of hand, indicating a series of serious policy failures."
introduction3 = "The Council for Asylum Affairs (CAA) accidentally acknowledges a huge problem with asylum seekers and tries to muddy up the facts. You won’t believe what they came up with next!"
introduction4 = "The Council for Asylum Affairs (CAA) puts out a report with vague and incomplete information about “incidents and reports” in detention centres across the country. Details are missing. What are we not allowed to know?"

numbers1 = ["Incidents: excuses to fine immigrants", "In total, the CAA has registered 9.166 reports of incidents in detention centres across the country. While this constitutes a slight increase when compared to previous years, only 166 reports have led to actual prosecutions (1.8%)."]
numbers2 = ["An explosive rise", "There were 9.166 incidents involving asylum seekers recorded in 2016, against approximately 3000 in all of 2015, already a record. This lead to an extreme burden on our police force, which had to be called in on 3.637 of these incidents."]
numbers3 = ["A crisis is looming?", "The CAA’s report is absolutely incredible. Despite all assertions to the contrary, the number of crimes committed by asylum seekers in detention centres has gone up by more than 300 percent. The consequences of this are looming large over our country."]
numbers4 = ["What really happened?", "The CAA claims it has registered almost 10.000 cases of “incidents” involving asylum seekers in 2016, but declines to elaborate. The government now appears to be trying to keep the explanation behind the numbers a state secret."]

perspective1 = "The vast majority of reports concern non-criminal incidents and meditative care. There have been “incidents” where people received fines for doing their dishes too late. Such trivial cases have been included in the CAA's calculations."
perspective2 = "These figures prove that immigration is creating a crime wave through all of our country. However, the CAA refuses to acknowledge this. Our government clearly chooses to defend these criminals by downplaying the threat to our people."
perspective3 = "What makes it even worse is that more than 3500 police reports were filed in 2016 about crimes committed by migrants. This doesn’t look good for the CAA, which is only digging itself into a deeper hole. It might not be long before even the government meets an untimely political end."
perspective4 = "The number of crimes is significantly higher compared to 2015. What is especially odd is that only a third of all reported incidents were passed on to the police. Less than 2% of reports led to any kind of criminal action."

cause1 = ["Dramatic claim with an innocuous cause", "The apparent spike is a direct consequence of the improved registration procedure that the CAA has begun to employ in 2016. Every detention centre now has a dedicated “prison warden” in charge of security, who reports any and all incidents immediately. "]
cause2 = ["More asylum seekers have come here", "This shocking crime spike is clearly the result of the weak stance of our government in the European Community. Our elite leaders have shown once again that they care only about their reputation, while each day New-Frisians are in danger."]
cause3 = ["A matter of time before blood is spilled", "The huge spike in the number of incidents is explained primarily by the large amount of newcomers in New-Frisian detention centres. They live in cramped spaces where frustration and radicalisation flourish. The mainstream media have been extremely lax in their reporting, which has left citizens with a serious information deficit."]
cause4 = ["Debunked justifications", "The report appears to be a response to a large amount of underground reporting about fights, sexual assaults and other high crimes occurring in detention centres, hidden from the public eye. The CAA seems to be covering itself by using already debunked explanations such as a “larger influx of refugees” and “better registration procedures”."]

problem1 = "One real problem, however, is the high occupancy rate in our nation’s detention centres. The lack of available facilities is quite clearly contributing to people’s sense of frustration and boredom, leaving them with nothing to do. "
problem2 = "The tensions that arise from this are being ignored. There are now more people in the country that can cause problems. On top of that, detention centres are usually located in small communities, where people simply aren’t prepared for such a huge influx of opportunistic immigrants."
problem3 = "An oft-forgotten consequence is that New-Frisian citizens are feeling more and more unsafe. While a huge number of incidents remains underreported, citizens everywhere read about these tremendous problems on the internet and social media. And they know: it won’t be long before the first deadly incident."
problem4 = "The explanations offered by the CAA and the government are typical but unconvincing. Both are drenched in a culture of secrecy. While nothing is certain, the discrepancy between the number of incidents reported and the explanations we’re given for this indicates a clear need for a real investigation."

expert1 = ["Low spike is a “small miracle”", "“For many refugees, the situation is untenable”, says John Kuhlschrank, leading expert at the Centre for Excellent Statistics. “They arrive here from active war zones and are put into what I can only describe as quasi-concentration camps. It’s a small miracle that so few of them are causing any problems at all.” "]
expert2 = ["Government is failing", "According to William Walsteen, a researcher affiliated with the reputable think tank The Right Way, the government is refusing to acknowledge the need for change. “New-Friesland cannot handle this many criminals. The areas that host them are losing control over them. What we need is a much stricter immigration policy than the one this government advocates.”"]
expert3 = ["Experts: ESCALATION IS NEAR", "Multiple experts now claim that both the media and politicians have underestimated the problem, and that the situation could escalate rapidly. “We need to keep our eyes and ears open. You never know where the danger is coming from”, says James Heaton, editor-in-chief of the popular online magazine Alt Fight. The end, it seems, is nowhere in sight."]
expert4 = ["Where is the evidence?", "Experts from across the web also remain entirely unconvinced. Patrick Hockstetter, editor-in-chief of the news blog Where There’s Smoke, says: “The CAA and the government are obviously in cahoots, they’re two sides of one loaded coin. The fact that the term “sexual assault” doesn’t even appear once in the document is very telling.”"]

conclusion1 = "While the problem is certainly not unmanageable, a few easy fixes should make the situation much more bearable. Then the CAA and others could perhaps spend some time working on much larger problems, such as discrimination against the newly arrived and the huge unemployment rate."
conclusion2 = "The CAA report’s conclusions are pretty close to undeniable: “The government of New-Friesland is clearly out of touch with the people and refuses to acknowledge that this failing policy of multiculturalism is a total disaster”, our expert adds. The obvious solution is not politically correct enough to even be considered, and people are clamouring louder and louder for real change. "
conclusion3 = "Alternative media have been hugely important in reporting about issues such as this one, which concerns all citizens of our beautiful country. The mainstream media have failed to live up to the trust we’ve put in them. We’re committed to keeping it real, and let you know what’s happening. Follow us on Twitter and Facebook, and stay safe."
conclusion4 = "Traditional media, especially newspapers and TV channels, have been far too accommodating in their coverage. It’s impossible to get the true version of events from media outlets that are clearly collaborating with the government to put forward a protective, politically correct narrative. Citizens of New-Friesland deserve the truth. We must not let them win."
